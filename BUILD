# Since some Java applications use different versions of ASM, we
# use JarJar to rename the ASM classes to something else, to avoid conflicts.
#
# Note that Flogger injection classes must not be renamed, because some injection strategies need
# the classes in the agent library to share information with the runtime library. This is safe
# however because none of the Flogger library itself is in the agent JAR, only the injection
# classes. We specify the entire "flogger" package as "non shaded" to mitigate the risk that the
# agent package (which is the only thing we actually care about) is ever renamed, as this would
# otherwise break log site injection in a very hard to understand way. Sadly there's no ability to
# add comments to the rules.txt files explaining this there.
